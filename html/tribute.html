                <h2>About Bruce Lee:</h2>

                <p>Lee Jun-fan (Chinese: 李振藩; November 27, 1940 – July 20, 1973), known professionally as Bruce Lee (Chinese: 李小龍), was a Hong Kong-American[3] actor, director, martial artist, martial arts instructor, and philosopher.[4] He was the founder of the hybrid martial arts Jeet Kune Do. Lee was the son of Cantonese opera star Lee Hoi-chuen. He is considered by commentators, critics, media, and other martial artists to be one of the most influential martial artists[5] and a pop culture icon of the 20th century.[6][7] He is often credited with helping to change the way Asians were presented in American films.[8]
                    <br/>
                Lee was born in the Chinatown area of San Francisco, California, on November 27, 1940, to parents from Hong Kong, and was raised with his family in Kowloon, Hong Kong.[9] He was introduced to the film industry by his father and appeared in several films as a child actor.
                    <br/>Lee moved to the United States at the age of 18 to receive his higher education at the University of Washington in Seattle,[10] and it was during this time that he began teaching martial arts. His Hong Kong and Hollywood-produced films elevated the traditional Hong Kong martial arts film to a new level of popularity and acclaim, sparking a surge of interest in Chinese martial arts in the West in the 1970s. The direction and tone of his films dramatically changed and influenced martial arts and martial arts films in the US, Hong Kong, and the rest of the world.[11]
                    <br/>
                He is noted for his roles in five feature-length films: Lo Wei's The Big Boss (1971) and Fist of Fury (1972); Golden Harvest's Way of the Dragon (1972), directed and written by Lee; Golden Harvest and Warner Brothers' Enter the Dragon (1973) and The Game of Death (1978), both directed by Robert Clouse.[12] Lee became an iconic figure known throughout the world, particularly among the Chinese, based upon his portrayal of Chinese nationalism in his films[13] and among Asian Americans for defying stereotypes associated with the emasculated Asian male.[14] He trained in the art of Wing Chun and later combined his other influences from various sources into the spirit of his personal martial arts philosophy, which he dubbed Jeet Kune Do (The Way of the Intercepting Fist). Lee held dual nationality in Hong Kong and the US.[15] He died in Hong Kong on July 20, 1973 at the age of 32, and was buried in Seattle.[16]
